  default_prompt: >-
    Use $weapp-vite-best-practices for project-level architecture and build
    orchestration in weapp-vite. Focus on `vite.config.ts` weapp options,
    route/subpackage strategy, chunk sharing, CLI dispatch ownership between
    `weapp-vite` and `weapp-ide-cli`, and CI/DevTools workflow. If the issue
    is mainly SFC macro/template syntax, delegate to
    $weapp-vite-vue-sfc-best-practices; if mainly runtime lifecycle/store, use
    $wevu-best-practices; if phased native migration, use
    $native-to-weapp-vite-wevu-migration. Return: diagnosis, minimal file-level
    changes, narrow verification commands, and tradeoff notes.
