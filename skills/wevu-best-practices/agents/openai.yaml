  short_description: wevu 运行时模式（生命周期、响应式更新、事件契约、storeToRefs/bindModel）
  default_prompt: >-
    Use $wevu-best-practices for runtime behavior in wevu pages/components/stores:
    lifecycle timing, reactive state updates, event contracts, `bindModel`,
    and store patterns (`storeToRefs`, setup store discipline). Prefer explicit
    mini-program semantics over Vue web assumptions. If the issue is mostly
    SFC macro/template compilation, use $weapp-vite-vue-sfc-best-practices; if
    it is project-level config/chunk/CI strategy, use
    $weapp-vite-best-practices; if it is phased native migration planning, use
    $native-to-weapp-vite-wevu-migration. Return: runtime risk summary,
    file-level edits, compatibility caveats, and minimal verification commands.
