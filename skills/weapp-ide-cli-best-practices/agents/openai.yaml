    Use $weapp-ide-cli-best-practices when working on weapp-ide-cli command
    design, command catalog exports, automator/config features, language
    switching, or cross-CLI dispatch contracts with weapp-vite. Keep command
    ownership deterministic: native command table first, then catalog-based
    passthrough only. Return concrete file-level edits, tests, and docs sync.
