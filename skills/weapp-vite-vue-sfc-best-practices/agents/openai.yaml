  default_prompt: >-
    Use $weapp-vite-vue-sfc-best-practices when the main task is authoring or
    refactoring mini-program `.vue` files: JSON macros, `usingComponents`,
    template directive compatibility, and SFC compile/runtime troubleshooting.
    Keep one macro family per SFC and check directive constraints (for example
    assignable `v-model` targets). If the issue is project-level
    build/subpackage/CI strategy, switch to $weapp-vite-best-practices; if it is
    primarily runtime lifecycle/store/event design, switch to
    $wevu-best-practices. Return: stage-based diagnosis, concrete SFC edits,
    compatibility notes, and minimal verification commands.
